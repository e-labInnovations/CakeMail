🎂 From Deprecated to Modern: The CakeMail Evolution Story

Last Sunday, I found myself staring at some strikethrough code in an old project. Google had deprecated the ContactsApp service I was using in CakeMail, my automated birthday greeting system. This sparked an exciting journey of modernization!

🔍 The Challenge:

- Migrate from deprecated ContactsApp to Google's People API
- Maintain existing functionality
- Add new features
- Improve security

🚀 The Solution:

- Implemented People API for contact management
- Added Telegram notifications
- Enhanced security with Properties Service
- Created beautiful, responsive email templates

💡 Key Learnings:

1. Future-proof your projects with modern APIs
2. Modular design makes migrations easier
3. Security should never be an afterthought
4. Multiple notification channels improve engagement

�� The Evolution:
2019: Basic Google Sheets + Docs
2020: HTML templates + tracking
2023: ContactsApp + WhatsApp
2025: People API + Telegram

The result? A more robust, secure, and feature-rich system that's ready for the future!
